    "text": "<p>Planners determine the amount of inventory needed for a given promotion of products. Often, a promotion involves advertising the product and selling it at a discounted price. Planning involves a strategic look at a product and a decision as to how it will be promoted. Planners discover answers to the following questions to help develop the plan:</p><ul><li>How have similar products sold in the past?</li><li>What was the cost?</li><li>What price should we set?</li><li>How many units of the product can we sell?</li></ul>"

    "title": "Promotions and Their Lifecycles",
    "text": "<p>It is challenging to plan a season in advance and respond during the season. I often work on multiple plans with varying durations at the same time. The duration depends on the products involved, location of the products, the organization’s goals, and seasonality. For example: A plan for Halloween decorations wouldn’t likely run through Christmas. These same considerations apply to promotional plans too.</p>"

    "title": "Factors of Planning",

Planners rely on these resources and people to make promotion planning decisions, including:</p><ul><li>What to promote</li><li>How much to discount the price, if at all</li><li>Where to promote: in locations that are similar based on their consumers—called clusters—or based on shared geographic areas—called regions</li><li>When to promote: should seasonality be considered? Is this product going to be on shelves year-round?</li><li>How many products and units of a product are required to maximize profit potential</li></ul>"

        "text": "The price the merchant has for these ugly sweaters isn’t much cheaper than sweaters that are noticeably not ugly. This price probably won’t appeal to customers if they’re only going to wear them once. The planner discounts them at a high rate for an attractive sale."

        "title": "When",
        "text": "Seasonality is the biggest factor for these items. The ugly sweaters should be on shelves for the holiday season, and they should swiftly be off shelves by the time the season ends. Who would buy an ugly sweater in July, even if it was marked off?"

        "title": "How Many",
        "text": "District Store Managers of retail clothing stores seem to think ugly sweaters would be nice items at a promotion price, but no one wants to have rack after rack. A relatively small amount is selected for the promotion."

    "title": "Time to Practice",
    "text": "<p>Our ugly holiday sweater example showed some wise decisions on how to plan a promotion for specialty item. But, imagine if there were missteps in certain aspects of the plan:</p><ul><li><strong>Promotional Discount:</strong> Too slight of a discount would result in few sales, and stores would have excess inventory that would need significant markdowns.</li><li><strong>Where:</strong> Ugly sweaters would attract few buyers in niche stores, boutiques, or high-end stores.</li><li><strong>When:</strong> They would not sell at any other time than the holidays.</li><li><strong>How Many:</strong> With any product, sending too many (overestimating demand) leads to unsold inventory that takes up space. Sending too few frustrates customers if demand is high.</li></ul><p>In the next activity, create a plan by consulting with professionals and making your own decisions about promoting a product.</p>"
